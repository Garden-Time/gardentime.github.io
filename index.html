    <h2> Description: </h2>
    <p> This is our work for Assignment 2 for Digital Humanities 110: User Interface and Design. </p>

    <h2> Process: </h2>
    <h3> 1. Idea proposal </h3>
        <h4> Description </h4>
        <p> Garden Time is the newest time-management app that rewards you for being on top of your daily schedule. Garden Time imports your to-do lists from other apps, includes a personal habits tracker, and allows you to schedule meetings all in one place. Garden Time also incorporates gamification. Users can earn points by completing their tasks on time, and use these points to grow plants and unlock plants at new levels for their garden. They can also earn bonus plants by completing challenges. </p>
        <h4> Application Functionality </h4>
        <p> The main screen of the app will be a garden, where the user can set goals and select a plan that best supports those types of goals. For instance, a user can select an academic plan and set a goal to complete a research paper by Wednesday. If a user doesnâ€™t complete their goals, a plant will not grow or even die. There will be separate plans with unique features, such as an academic plan that allows users to import work from Canvas and other educational platforms, a work plan that allows users to import tasks and meetings from their emails and other communication platforms, a workout plan that pairs with health applications like Apple Fitness to track fitness goals, or a productivity plan for users who wishes to set goals like to not be on social media. </p>
        <h4> Information architecture </h4>
        <p> Information will ideally be imported from other apps, so that Garden Time centralizes all information in one place for its users. The time-based features will be organized into a calendar, where users can see what is planned for each day and review what theyâ€™ve completed in the past. Users can customize and use default notifications, such as 5, 3, and 1 day reminders for big assignments. For features that do not have a deadline, like grocery or reading lists, there will be a separate section in the app where this is accessible. </p>
